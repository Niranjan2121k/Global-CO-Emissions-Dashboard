  - Gradual decline of the dominant region.
  - Emergence of new contributors as global industrialization expands.

- **Mid-1900s (WWI & WWII Era):**  
  - Peaks and valleys in certain countries' emissions.
  - Countries like the US and USSR likely show noticeable growth during these periods.

- **Post-1950s:**  
  - Global distribution of emissions increases.
  - More countries industrialize and contribute to emissions.

- **2000‚Äì2020:**  
  - Emerging economies rise in share.
  - Some developed countries reduce their global share due to policy changes or outsourcing.

## üåç Map Overview

### **Color Legend:**
- Located on the right, the color scale represents **CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita**.
- **Dark Blue ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red Gradient:**
  - **Dark Blue:** Low CO‚ÇÇ per capita (e.g. many African and South Asian countries)
  - **Purple:** Moderate emissions (e.g. parts of Europe, South America)
  - **Orange/Red:** High CO‚ÇÇ per capita (e.g. North America, Australia, parts of the Middle East)

---

## üó∫ Key Insights

- **North America (U.S. & Canada):**  
  Bright red and orange, indicating **very high CO‚ÇÇ emissions per person**.

- **Europe & Russia:**  
  Varies from pink to red, indicating moderate to high per capita emissions.

- **Middle East (e.g., Saudi Arabia, UAE):**  
  Extremely high per capita emissions (yellow to bright red).

- **Africa & South Asia:**  
  Mostly deep blue and purple shades, reflecting **very low CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita**.

- **China & India:**  
  Purple to orange tones, showing **growing but still moderate per capita emissions**.

---

## üìå Notes

- This visualization does **not represent total emissions**, but rather **per person** emissions.  
  For example, although China emits more CO‚ÇÇ in total, its **per capita emission is lower** than that of countries like the US or Saudi Arabia.

- Useful for understanding **emission inequality**, where **developed nations have far higher per-person contributions** to global emissions.
